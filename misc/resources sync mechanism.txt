When a resource is started, the mechanism starts in the server, it will send an information packet (with the meta file too, including timestamps), to all
clients connected through TCP, the client will verify the files and request the ones that are outdated or don't exist. The server will send the files requested
by each client and notify the client that the resource is ready to be loaded.
